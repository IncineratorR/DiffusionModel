# DiffusionModel
"Diffusion models are cutting-edge tools in machine learning known for their ability to generate highly realistic data samples, making them valuable for tasks like image synthesis, denoising, and data augmentation. These models use a unique iterative process to progressively refine noisy data into accurate representations of complex data distributions.
